* VR *re:stream*

** General

This is literate documentation for the VR native streaming desktop
application. The stack is based on
- [[http://clojure.org/][Clojure]]
- [[https://github.com/daveray/seesaw][seesaw]] [a LISPy Swing wrapper]
- [[https://github.com/Chouser/clojure-jna][clojure-jna]] [Dynamically load and use native C libs from Clojure using JNA]

** libshout-java

*** Install
    Tested on Debian Jessie

**** Checkout libshout-java
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
apt-get install git libshout3-dev maven
git clone https://github.com/OlegKunitsyn/libshout-java.git
cd libshout-java
#+END_SRC

**** Fix a test (otherwise it will not install)

 - Fix the test /testVersion()/ in
   /src/test/java/com/gmail/kunicins/olegs/libshout/LibshoutTest.java/ to
   check for your installed version of libshout
 - It's tested and working with version 2.3.1
 - Find your version via

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
pt-cache show libshout3-dev | ag version | egrep -o "2.[0-9].[0-9]"
#+END_SRC

  - Then install the library to your local maven repository so that
    `lein deps` can find it

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
mvn install
#+END_SRC

**** TODO Move this compiled Library to a HTTP repo so that not every user has to install it to a local repo

** TODOs
*** TODO Integrate a Vorbis Encoder

**** [[http://svn.xiph.org/trunk/vorbis-java/][vorbis-java]]
     This is the official Java lib from Xiph, the creators of Ogg
     Vorbis. It has example source and even a port of the libshout lib.

     Unfortunately, though, it hasn't been updated since 2007, is
still in Beta and not available from Maven. For a manual install,
package the Class files with *jar cf something.jar [files]* and then
create a local Maven Repo for Leiningen: http://www.elangocheran.com/blog/2013/03/installing-jar-files-locally-for-leiningen-2/

     Note that putting a Jar into */lib* or using *:resource-paths* in
     project.clj doesn't seem to be the way to go since Leiningen 2.


*** Maybe not required
**** TODO Test streaming using [[https://github.com/OlegKunitsyn/libshout-java][libshout-java]]
**** TODO Alternatively test streaming using [[https://github.com/xiph/Icecast-libshout][native libshout library]] through
- Either through clojure-jna or Java JNA

** Development

*** Package for OS X

To start of packaging the Java Swing GUI for OS X, let's pack the
whole app inside of a stand alone jar.

To create a standalone Java Application through Leiningen, the main
class of the program has to be put into *project.clj* as the value of
the *:main* key. For this class to be available during the build
process, *(:gen-class)* has to be called within the *(ns)* declaration
of the responsible Clojure file. Documentation on how to achieve this
can be found [[http://asymmetrical-view.com/2010/06/08/building-standalone-jars-wtih-leiningen.html][here]].

When curious, try starting the jar manually

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
java -jar target/clojure_desktop_app_demo-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT-standalone.jar
#+END_SRC sh

#+RESULTS:

The resulting JAR file is ready to be packaged into a Mac OS X
Installer.
