* VR *re:stream*

** General
  
This is literate documentation for the VR native streaming desktop
application. The stack is based on
- [[http://clojure.org/][Clojure]]
- [[https://github.com/daveray/seesaw][seesaw]] [a LISPy Swing wrapper]
- [[https://github.com/Chouser/clojure-jna][clojure-jna]] [Dynamically load and use native C libs from Clojure using JNA]

** TODOs
** TODO Access the mic using Java
- Either natively
- Or get the code from a Clojure library like [[https://github.com/overtone/overtone][Overtone]]

** TODO Test streaming using [[https://github.com/OlegKunitsyn/libshout-java][libshout-java]]
** TODO Alternatively test streaming using [[https://github.com/xiph/Icecast-libshout][native libshout library]] through
- Either through clojure-jna or Java JNA

** Development

*** Package for OS X

To start of packaging the Java Swing GUI for OS X, let's pack the
whole app inside of a stand alone jar.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
lein uberjar
#+END_SRC sh
